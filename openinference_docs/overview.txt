this is openinference's fork of opencode. open inference is launching a "chatbot arena for coding". 
this fork powered exclusively by the openinference proxy defined in "/home/mark/vllm_server_code_votes".
user uses duel mode by setting model to "duel", or normal mode by setting model to anything else
currently, the app is effectively ready for launch - the only thing remaining is making edit permissionprompts non-blocking

duel mode worktrees:
in duel mode, edits from each side now go to isolated git worktrees (/tmp/opencode-duel-<id>/left and /tmp/opencode-duel-<id>/right) instead of the real codebase. this is wired through duel.ts, prompt.ts, the SDK, and the write/edit tools. working on now: make the worktree paths invisible to the model and user (tool titles, permission patterns, and message history currently leak /tmp/opencode-duel paths).
