we give 1 worktree to each model in duel mode
when you vote for either side, their worktree changes will be merged into your code
- if you make changes to your files while a duel is happening, the worktrees will not update
in duel mode everything is auto-approve - it wont work otherwise
your permissions config will only effect normal mode
