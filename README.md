# VibeDuel

A community-driven AI coding assistant for your terminal. Fork of [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode), powered by VibeDuel — giving you access to the best LLMs at no cost.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vibeduel.ai/install | bash
```

The install script will:
- Install the correct version of Bun (if needed)
- Build the binary for your platform

Open a new terminal, then run:

```bash
opencode
```

## How it works

### Get an API key

Sign up at [vibeduel.ai](https://vibeduel.ai) to get your free API key. On first launch, OpenCode will prompt you to paste it.

### Credits

You start with **100 credits**. Each request costs **1 credit**. To earn more, use duel mode.

### Duel mode

When you send a message in duel mode, two anonymous models respond to the same prompt side by side. You vote for the better response and earn **50 credits**. Duel requests themselves are free.

Your votes feed an ELO leaderboard that ranks models against each other — helping the community figure out which models are actually best for coding tasks.
